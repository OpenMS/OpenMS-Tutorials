\section{Troubleshooting guide}
This section will show you where you can turn to when you encounter any problems with this tutorial or with our
nodes in general. Please see the FAQ first. If your problem is not listed or the proposed solution does not work,
feel free to leave us a message at the means of support that you see most fit.

\subsection{FAQ}

\subsubsection{General}
\textbf{Q:} Can I add my own modifications to the Unimod.xml?\\
\textbf{A:} Unfortunately not very easy. This is an open issue.
\\\\
\textbf{Q:} I have problem XYZ but it also occurs with other nodes or generally in the KNIME environment/GUI, what should I do?\\
\textbf{A:} This sounds like a general KNIME bug and we advise to search help directly at the KNIME developers. They also provide a \href{https://tech.knime.org/
faq}{FAQ} and a \href{https://tech.knime.org/forum}{forum}.

\subsubsection{Platform-specific problems}
\textbf{Linux}\\
\textbf{Q:} Whenever I try to execute an OpenMS node I get an error similar to these:
\begin{verbatim}
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1: version `GOMP_4.0' not found
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found
\end{verbatim}
\textbf{A:} We currently build the binaries shipped in the OpenMS KNIME plugin with gcc 4.8. We will try to extend our support for older compilers.
Until then you either need to upgrade your gcc compiler
or at least the library that the tool complained about or you need to build the
binaries yourself (see OpenMS documentation) and replace them in your KNIME binary folder\\
(\menu{YOURKNIMEFOLDER/plugins/de.openms.platform.architecture.version/payload/bin}).
\\\\
\textbf{Q:} Why is my configuration dialog closing right away when I double-click or try to configure it? Or why is my GUI responding so slow?\\
\textbf{A:} If you have any problems with the KNIME GUI or the opening of dialogues under Linux you might be affected by a
GTK bug. See the KNIME forum (e.g. \href{https://tech.knime.org/forum/knime-general/ubuntu-1604-slow-performance}{here} or \href{https://tech.knime.org/forum/knime-users/knime-300-crashes-after-splash-screen}{here}) for a discussion and a possible solution.\\\\
\textbf{Windows}\\
\textbf{Q:} KNIME has problems getting the requirements for some of the OpenMS nodes on Windows, what can I do?\\
\textbf{A:} Get the prerequisites installer \href{\WindowsPrerequisitesLink}{here} or install NET3.5, NET4 and VCRedist10.0 yourself.\\
\subsubsection{Nodes}
\textbf{Q:} Why is my XTandemAdapter printing empty results?\\
\textbf{A:} From OpenMS 2.0.1 the XTandemAdapter requires a default parameter file. Give it the default configuration in\\
\menu{YOURKNIMEFOLDER/plugins/de.openms.platform.architecture.version/payload/share/}\\
\menu{CHEMISTRY/XTandem\_default\_input.xml} as a third input file.
\\\\
\textbf{Q:} Do MSGFPlusAdapter and LuciphorAdapter generally behave different/unexpected?\\
\textbf{A:} These are Java processes that are started underneath. For example they can not be killed during cancellation of the node.
This should not affect its performance, however.
